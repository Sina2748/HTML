                  Hi. My name is Sina. In 2016, I founded Crepin.ir, an
                  eCommerce website where I designed, produced and marketed
                  journaling accessories. In 2020, I managed to outsource most
                  of the repetitive tasks of my business and go after my interests
                  in code and programming. Django, Flutter and React are some of
                  the frameworks I have focused on.

          <h3>Crepin, from a course project to a business</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, Crepin was the name of the product I had to present as a
            course project. We each had to take a new product idea and prepare a
            business plan for its commercialisation. Mine was a cork board cut
            in tiny shapes so that it looked like a pattern when mounted on the
            wall. Later I changed its material from cork to foam and introduced
            colour to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freshly graduated from university, I joined a printing company, but
            the idea never left my mind. It became my side hustle for a couple
            of years, where I produced it in tiny amounts, tested the market,
            and tried to sell it in shops. The turning point was when I tried
            social media marketing and made a WordPress eCommerce website.

          <h3>Investment and growth</h3>
          <p>
            I invested a small amount in Crepin, and little by little it grew.
            More confident in its success, I added other new products to the
            website. Among which was a notebook where customers could choose its
            paper thickness, number of pages, and design of its print, from
            dotted, lined, or checked. We also had 50 cover designs they could
            choose from. Learning Agile production from University, I designed
            the notebooks with many customisation options, and customer response
            was incredible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now Crepin was my primary source of income. I quit my job and mainly
            focused on Crepin. Our notebooks, especially our dotted notebooks,
            became very popular. I targeted the online productivity communities
            and bullet journaling pages on Instagram with our SEO and
            Micro-Influencer Marketing, which couldn’t work better. We rank 1.4
            on google for Persian translation of the keyword “Bullet Journal”
            and have nearly 30k followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crepin.ir/">Instagram</a>.

          <h3>I built an App</h3>
          <p>
            After Covid hit, I let go of my three employees and outsourced the
            fulfilment process of the orders. This way, I had more free time to
            sign up for a Python Bootcamp. My main driver for learning to code
            is my curiosity. However, as I learned, I think of all the
            implications the topics can have on my business. For Example, I used
            Instaloader, which is a Python package with great functionalities
            for scrapping Instagram to find Micro-Influencer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aiming to build an app for Crepin, I changed my focus to Dart and
            Flutter. It app is tailored for our main customers to educate them
            about new productivity techniques followed by some tools. It
            connects to supabais for authentication and uses custom pain widget
            and isolates in some of the tools.
